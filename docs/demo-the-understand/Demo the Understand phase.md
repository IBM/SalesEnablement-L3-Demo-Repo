5. It may take a moment for the **GenApp â€“ Transaction Call Graph Analysis** pop-up that is needed to do the next step to appear. 
   
   You will see an **executing Transaction Callgraph** message at the bottom of the pop-up displaying a green progress bar (A). 

   Select everything in the **Available transactions** box using the **add all items** button (looks like a fast forward button) (B), and move them to the **Selected transactions** box.
   
   Then click **Finish** (C) to load the transactions.

   A call graph is loaded with all the transactions in this profiled application. (Note: it may take a few minutes for the graph to build.)

6. Zoom in so you can see the transaction named **SSC1** (A). This transaction is related to the CUSTOMER table. The SSC1 transaction is used to add, insert, and update the CUSTOMER table. SSC1 is used in the next phase of this demo.

   **Note**: There are some tools in the upper right corner of the graph view to help you navigate and zoom. 
   - Use the **Mouse Pan Tool** to move to different areas of the graph. Click the **Mouse Pan tool** (the icon looks like a hand) in the top right and drag the hand icon around the graph to pan to different areas.
   - Use the **Interactive Zoom Tool** to zoom in and out of the graph. Click the **Interactive Zoom Tool** (the icon looks like a magnifying glass with an arrow inside it). Click and hold on an area on the graph and if you drag your cursor downwards, this will zoom in to the graph. Click and hold on an area on the graph and and if you drag your cursor upwards, this will zoom out of the graph.
   - Use the **Marquee Zoom Tool** to zoom into a specific area. Click **Marquee Zoom tool** (the icon looks like a magnifying glass) in the top right and drag your cursor to draw a box around a specific area on the graph. Once you release your cursor, the graph will be zoomed into that area. 
   - Use the **Fit in Canvas Tool** (the icon looks like a magnifying glass with red corners) to zoom the graph back out to full view. 
   
      As you use these tools, the **Graph Overview** window in the upper left allows you to see where you are in the graph and will highlight the area with a blue box.
7. Select the **Explore** tab (A) to return to the view in Step 4 where a list of options appears on the right side of the screen under the **quick filter** box. 
   
   In this new field, expand the **Mainframe Graphs** twistie (B) and double-click the **Transaction Callgraph** option (C). (Although you could enter Transaction Callgraph in the quick filter field to find the item more quickly.)
