5. It may take a moment for the **GenApp â€“ Transaction Call Graph Analysis** pop-up that is needed to do the next step to appear. 
   
   You will see an **executing Transaction Callgraph** message at the bottom of the pop-up displaying a green progress bar (A). 

   Select everything in the **Available transactions** box using the **add all items** button (looks like a fast forward button) (B), and move them to the **Selected transactions** box.
   
   Then click **Finish** (C) to load the transactions.

   A call graph is loaded with all the transactions in this profiled application. (Note: it may take a few minutes for the graph to build.)

8. Zoom in so you can see the transaction named **SSC1** (A). This transaction is related to the CUSTOMER table. The SSC1 transaction is used to Add, Insert, and Update the CUSTOMER table. SSC1 will be used in the next phase.
